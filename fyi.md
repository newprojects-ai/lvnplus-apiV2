   - Remainder questions go to lower levels
3. Keep the existing test plan creation flow intact
4. Only modify the question count generation

#### Implementation Details
- Location: `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Current Logic:
  ```typescript
  Example: 13 questions total
  - Base: floor(13/5) = 2 per level
  - Remainder: 13 % 5 = 3
  - Distribution: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2}
  ```

#### Testing Notes
- Verify test plan creation still works

- Current Logic:
  ```typescript
  Example: 13 questions total
  - Base: floor(13/5) = 2 per level
  - Remainder: 13 % 5 = 3
  - Distribution: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2}
  ```

#### Testing Notes

    return defaultValue;
  }
  
  try {
    if (typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() === '') {
      throw new Error('Empty string is not a valid BigInt');
    }
    
    const result = typeof value === 'string' ? BigInt(value) : value;
    
    if (result === BigInt(0) && value !== '0' && value !== 0n) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid BigInt value: ${value}`);
    }
    
    return result;
  } catch (error) {

- Location: `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Current Logic:
  ```typescript
  Example: 13 questions total
  - Base: floor(13/5) = 2 per level
  - Remainder: 13 % 5 = 3
  - Distribution: {1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 2}
  ```

#### Testing Notes
- Verify test plan creation still works
- Confirm question counts sum equals total requested
- Check distribution across difficulty levels

### Question Distribution Utility Implementation (2024-12-11)

#### Utility Overview
- Created `src/utils/questionDistribution.ts`
- Implemented flexible question distribution mechanism
- Supports configurable difficulty levels (1-5)

#### Key Functions
1. `distributeQuestions(totalQuestions, levels)`
   - Distributes questions across specified difficulty levels
   - Default is 3 levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
   - Handles remainders by adding to initial levels
   - Validates input and ensures distribution is within 1-5 levels

2. `validateQuestionDistribution(distribution)`
   - Validates the generated question distribution
   - Ensures all levels are between 1-5
   - Checks that total questions match the input

#### Distribution Strategy
- Uses floor division for base distribution
- Adds remainder questions to initial levels
- Supports dynamic level count (1-5)

#### Example Distributions
```typescript
distributeQuestions(13)  // { 1: 5, 2: 4, 3: 4 }
distributeQuestions(10, 5)  // { 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 2 }
```

#### Benefits
- Configurable and flexible
- Maintains consistent distribution logic
- Easy to test and maintain
- Supports future expansion of difficulty levels

#### Integration
- Used in `testPlan.service.ts` for question selection
- Enhances test plan creation process
- Improves question allocation strategy

#### Next Steps
- Add comprehensive unit tests
- Consider performance optimizations
- Explore additional distribution strategies

#### Recommendations
- Validate distribution results in test scenarios
- Monitor test plan creation with new utility
- Gather feedback on distribution effectiveness

### BigInt Conversion and Error Handling Improvements (2024-12-11 at 09:45:33 UTC)

#### Timestamp
- **Date**: 2024-12-11
- **Time**: 09:45:33 UTC
- **Logged By**: Cascade AI Assistant

#### Problem Identification
- `safeBigInt` utility silently failing and returning `0n` for invalid inputs
- Insufficient validation in execution controller
- Poor error messages for invalid execution IDs

#### Changes Made
1. **Enhanced safeBigInt Utility**
   - Added validation for empty strings
   - Improved error handling for invalid BigInt values
   - Added detailed error logging with value type information
   - Now throws ValidationError instead of returning default value

2. **Execution Controller Improvements**
   - Added validation for execution ID format
   - Improved error messages for missing user ID
   - Removed default '0' value for missing user ID

#### Implementation Details
```typescript
// Updated safeBigInt implementation
private safeBigInt(value: bigint | string | undefined, defaultValue: bigint = BigInt(0)): bigint {
  if (value === undefined) {
    return defaultValue;
  }
  
  try {
    if (typeof value === 'string' && value.trim() === '') {
      throw new Error('Empty string is not a valid BigInt');
    }
    
    const result = typeof value === 'string' ? BigInt(value) : value;
    
    if (result === BigInt(0) && value !== '0' && value !== 0n) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid BigInt value: ${value}`);
    }
    
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new ValidationError(`Invalid execution ID: ${value}`);
  }
}

// Updated controller validation
if (!id || isNaN(Number(id))) {
  return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Invalid execution ID provided' });
}
